# React Router + GitHub Pages Example

This repository demonstrates how to deploy a React app that uses React Router to GitHub Pages. It uses `HashRouter` to enable client-side SPA routing without 404 errors on refresh or direct URL access.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Clone, install, and run the app:**

```git clone```

 ```https://github.com/rahulshahare/react-router-gh-pages.git```

```cd react-router-gh-pages```

```npm install```

```npm start```


**To build and deploy to GitHub Pages:**
npm run deploy

## 📝 Scripts in `package.json`

- `npm start`: Launch development server.
- `npm run build`: Create production build.
- `npm run deploy`: Push build to GitHub Pages.

---

## 🛠️ Routing Details

Since GitHub Pages serves only static files, we use `HashRouter` to keep routing on the client side. All navigation stays functional across page reloads and direct URLs.
